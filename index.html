      <h2>Our Stregnths</h2>
      <h3>Over the past 3 years Maps for schools have grown tremendously. Our efficient code allowed us to map out thousands of schools on the West Coast. The numerous grants have also enabled us to move into the East Coast. Additionally, these grants have helped us in developing a great user interface improving our customers' experience. We are also able to differentiate ourselves by having several key features (like our ground view and room number-subject conversion) that allow us to stay unique and in a high place in the market. </h2>
      <h2> Opportunities</h2>
      <h3>Maps For Schools has accumulated many opportunities as we grow. A few of such opportunities are our partnerships with Arizona State University, the top 1 populated school with over 183,000 students, Princeton university, one of the most regarded Universities in the U.S.A, and Stanford, having one of the largest compasses. With these partnerships our business will show our effectiveness and friendly use. </h3>
